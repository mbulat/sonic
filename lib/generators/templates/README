===============================================================================

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

 1. Ensure you have defined your checks in the sonic_config.rb file.
    This file is now located in config/initializers/sonic_config.rb 
    and includes a sample configration. Be sure to read the Sonic README
    for more information.

 2. A sample Clockwork clock file has been provided an
    lib/sonic_clock.rb. You'll want to include this in your Procfile or
    somehow set this to be daemonized in your production environment.
